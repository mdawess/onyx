@Cole:
### Scholar page
- [ ] Add instagram widget

### Jobs
- [ ] Style the modal with more job info
    - Look at the db schema to get an idea of the data you want to use
    - Don't need to pull in any new data for this, the job prop already passed contains everything.
      You'll just need to use it & style it
- [ ] Link the filter on the LHS
    - This should be similar to the search functionality.

### Employer
- [ ] Clean this page up. The search bar already works, so just clean up the cards and make them redirect
      to the job page.
      - Reference the way I redirect in the search bar. It should be pretty similar.

### Favourites
- [ ] This should use the same job cards that are used on the Scholar and Jobs page. Just make sure you
      use the GET_FAVOURITES query to get the data.
      - Just copy the code from the Scholar page and change the query.

### Profile

- [ ] The profile page should use the current users data and allow them to edit
- [ ] Create a pane for them to check all of their views
